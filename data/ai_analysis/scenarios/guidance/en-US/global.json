  "analysis": "Okay, here is a concise breakdown for using the configured market scenario:\n\n**Scenario Analysis: {scenario_config}**\n\n**1. Purpose & Usage:**\n*   **Name:** {scenario_name} - This provides a quick reference for the specific market condition being simulated.\n*   **Description:** {scenario_description} - This explains the *nature* of the simulated event (e.g., sudden news-driven volatility, gradual market exhaustion, sustained trend continuation). Use this to understand the context and expected market dynamics.\n*   **Market Context:** {scenario_market} - This specifies the underlying asset or market (e.g., EUR/USD, AAPL, Crude Oil). Your trading strategy or analysis should be applied within this specific market context.\n\n**2. Stress Level Analysis:**\n*   **{scenario_stress}** - This quantifies the overall volatility and intensity of the simulated market conditions.\n    *   **Low Stress:** Expect relatively stable prices, gradual movements, and less frequent or less impactful order flow. Agents are likely to be more methodical.\n    *   **Medium Stress:** Prices will exhibit more volatility and range-bound activity. Agents are likely to be more active but perhaps still somewhat predictable.\n    *   **High Stress:** Expect significant price swings, potential gaps, high volatility, and rapid changes in sentiment. Agents are likely to be more reactive and potentially less rational.\n\n**3. Agent Behavior Analysis:**\n*   **{scenario_agent_behaviors}** - This defines how the simulated agents (representing different market participants like traders, institutions, algorithms) are expected to act.\n    *   **Examples:** High stress might include \"increased short-term speculation,\" \"hedging pressure,\" \"algorithmic trend following,\" or \"sell-off behavior.\" Low stress might include \"consolidation,\" \"slow digestion of news,\" or \"steady trend continuation.\"\n    *   **Action:** Observe how the simulated agents' actions drive the market dynamics described in the description and stress level. Look for emergent patterns based on these behavioral rules.\n\n**4. Outcome Interpretation:**\n*   **Trading Signals:** Analyze price action, volume, and order flow characteristics generated by the scenario to identify potential entry/exit points or trend signals relevant to your strategy.\n*   **Risk Assessment:** Use the stress level and agent behaviors to gauge the potential risk and volatility associated with the simulated conditions. Higher stress generally implies higher risk.\n*   **Strategy Validation:** Test how your trading strategy performs under the specific dynamics defined by this scenario (e.g., does it survive a high-stress sell-off? Does it profit from medium-stress range-bound conditions?).\n*   **Edge Cases:** Identify potential edge cases or failure modes for your strategy based on how agents behave under the specified stress conditions.\n\n**In Summary:**\nTreat this scenario as a controlled environment to test specific market dynamics. Use the stress level and agent behaviors to understand the intensity and nature of the simulated conditions. Analyze the resulting market action to derive actionable insights for trading, risk management, or strategy development. Remember, this is a simulation; real-world markets may have additional complexities.",
  "tooltip": "Based on the provided {scenario_config}, the most critical scenario to run next is:\n\n**Scenario: Sell**\n\n**Rationale:** High probability (70%) of a sell signal from the algorithm combined with an expected market volatility and a defined stop-loss threshold (5%) makes this the highest priority action to mitigate potential losses.",
