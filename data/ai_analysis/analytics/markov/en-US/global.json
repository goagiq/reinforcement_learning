  "analysis": "Okay, here is concise, actionable guidance based on the typical findings of a Markov Regime Switching (MRS) analysis, structured as requested.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Since I cannot directly access the contents of `{markov_report}`, this guidance is based on the *general principles and typical interpretations* of MRS analysis results. You will need to apply this framework using the specific findings from your report.\n\n---\n\n**Markov Regime Analysis Results & Actionable Guidance**\n\n**1. Regime Identification & Probabilities:**\n\n*   **Typical Finding:** The analysis likely identified distinct market regimes (e.g., Bull, Bear, Low Volatility, High Volatility, Trend Following, Mean Reverting).\n*   **Actionable Guidance:**\n    *   **Confirm Current Regime:** Identify the most probable regime the market is currently in based on the highest probability state. This informs your core strategy selection.\n        *   *Example:* If the current regime is \"Low Volatility,\" focus on range-bound strategies or trend-following with tight stops. If it's \"High Volatility,\" consider trend-following with appropriate risk management or volatility-targeting strategies.\n    *   **Monitor Regime Shifts:** Pay close attention to transitions between regimes. A shift from \"Bull\" to \"Volatile\" might warrant a defensive stance or tighter stops. A shift from \"Low Volatility\" to \"Bear\" requires risk mitigation.\n\n**2. Probability of Regimes:**\n\n*   **Typical Finding:** Provides the probability distribution across all regimes at the current point in time.\n*   **Actionable Guidance:**\n    *   **Assess Market Sentiment:** High probability in \"Bull\" or \"Bear\" regimes aligns with prevailing sentiment. Low probabilities suggest uncertainty or mixed conditions.\n    *   **Diversify Strategically:** If no single regime has a dominant probability, consider diversifying across strategies designed for different regimes (e.g., run a trend-following strategy in trending regimes and a mean-reversion strategy in ranging regimes).\n\n**3. Transition Probabilities:**\n\n*   **Typical Finding:** Shows the likelihood of moving from one regime to another (e.g., Bull -> Bear, Low Volatility -> High Volatility).\n*   **Actionable Guidance:**\n    *   **Predict Market Behavior:** Use transition probabilities to anticipate potential regime changes. High probability transitions (e.g., Bear -> High Volatility) can signal potential risk amplification or trend acceleration.\n    *   **Position Sizing:** Adjust position sizes based on the probability of staying in the current regime versus transitioning. Higher probability of staying might allow for larger positions, while a high probability of transition warrants caution or hedging.\n\n**4. Confidence Levels:**\n\n*   **Typical Finding:** Confidence levels are inherent in MRS analysis through state probabilities and transition probabilities. The *report* might explicitly state confidence in the regime identification or specific transitions.\n*   **Actionable Guidance & Discussion:**\n    *   **Confidence in Current Regime:** High probability for the current regime (e.g., >70-80%) generally lends more confidence in the analysis and the recommended strategy. Lower probabilities indicate less certainty.\n    *   **Confidence in Transitions:** High probability transitions (e.g., >60-70%) can be considered more likely and potentially actionable. Low probability transitions are less likely to occur but should not be dismissed entirely.\n    *   **Overall Confidence:** MRS models provide probabilistic forecasts, not certainties. Confidence should be moderate to high for regime identification but always tempered with the understanding that markets are dynamic and models have limitations. Avoid overconfidence, especially when probabilities are near 50/50 or when multiple regimes have similar probabilities.\n    *   **Action:** Base trading decisions on the *probabilities*, not absolutes. Use the analysis as a framework for risk management and strategy selection, not as a crystal ball. Continuously monitor market conditions and update your understanding.\n\n**Summary Action Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the current regime** with the highest probability.\n2.  **Select a core strategy** aligned with that regime's characteristics.\n3.  **Monitor regime probabilities** and watch for significant shifts or transitions.\n4.  **Adjust risk management** based on the probability of staying in the current regime or transitioning.\n5.  **Maintain moderate confidence** in the analysis but remain flexible, as market dynamics can change rapidly.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Review `{markov_report}`:** Carefully analyze the specific regimes, probabilities, and transition matrices presented.\n2.  **Map Regimes to Trading Rules:** Define precise trading rules for each identified regime.\n3.  **Integrate into System:** Incorporate the regime analysis output into your existing trading system or decision process.\n4.  **Backtest:** Ensure the regime-based strategy performs well historically under the identified regime conditions.",
